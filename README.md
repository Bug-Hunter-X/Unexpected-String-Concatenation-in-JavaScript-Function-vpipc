This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating an uncommon bug related to type coercion and unexpected string concatenation within a function. The bug showcases a scenario where adding a number and a string results in string concatenation instead of numerical addition, leading to incorrect results. The solution provides a corrected version of the function that handles type coercion appropriately to ensure accurate numerical addition.
